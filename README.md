# Recommendation-System-on-Yelp-Dataset
In this project, we created a recommendation system for restaurants using collaborative filtering (CF). We used the Yelp Dataset for this. 

The general structure of a recommendation system is that there are users and there are items. Users express explicit or implicit preferences towards certain items.

The data: https://www.yelp.com/dataset

Please read about the dataset here: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main 

Using EDA on dataset and imputing the Nan values with the appropriate place wherever required

 As we can see from the above SGD not only recommends the resturants name it also suggests the reviews that prooves to be more accurate recommendation.
